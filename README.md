# SynthriseERC20Token


A simple Smart Contract, built with Solidity.

Synthrise ERC20 Token has a supply of 100,000Tokens and the contract has the following permissions

* Mintable (Supply can be added, if you have such privilege)
* Burnable (Token Holders can burn and 'destroy' the token and thus decrease its supply)
* Pausable (This is a dangerous permission, as it makes the Token extremely centralized, and if you have the privilege you can ''pause'' transactions involving the Token, usually used to correct failures, but it's still good to avoid it)


It was deployed via Ethereum Remix and you can check it out on Etherscan:
